# NightShade
## What is NightShade?
NightShade is a Work in Progress Discord Bot made by me, written in python, which I am using, as well as just being a cool project, to learn more, and become a better programmer. It is currently being hosted on [Replit](https://replit.com/@UpFromTheShadow/NightShade#main.py), so that I can easily run and test it
## What are the Current Features of NightShade?
It currently has some simple commands, more of a test than anything useful, which I will replace with more useful ones when I can, and it is soon to have AI integration with GPT for all your AI desires.

These Test Commands are: ]hello, which replies with a simple Hello!; ]shrug which replies with ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯; and finally ]help, which gives a simple explanation about itself and links to this repository and to Replit too.
